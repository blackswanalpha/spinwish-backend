## API Testing with Postman/cURL

### Accept Request
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/requests/{requestId}/accept \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {dj_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "amount": 50.0,
  "djId": "uuid",
  "clientId": "uuid",
  "songId": "uuid",
  "message": "Great song!",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T12:05:00"
}
```

### Reject Request
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/requests/{requestId}/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {dj_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected Response: Same structure with `status: "REJECTED"`

### Get Earnings Summary
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/earnings/summary?period=month" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {dj_token}"
```

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Request Status
```sql
SELECT id, status, amount, created_at, updated_at 
FROM requests 
WHERE id = '{request_id}';
```

### Check Refund Records
```sql
SELECT r.id, r.amount, r.status, r.initiated_at, r.completed_at, rp.receipt_number
FROM refunds r
JOIN request_payments rp ON r.request_payment_id = rp.id
WHERE rp.request_id = '{request_id}';
```

### Check DJ Earnings
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(rp.amount) as total_from_requests,
  COUNT(*) as request_count
FROM request_payments rp
JOIN requests req ON rp.request_id = req.id
WHERE req.dj_id = '{dj_id}' 
  AND req.status = 'ACCEPTED';
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Test: Multiple Concurrent Approvals
1. Create 50 pending requests
2. Accept all 50 requests simultaneously
3. âœ… All requests processed successfully
4. âœ… No race conditions
5. âœ… Earnings calculated correctly
6. âœ… Response time < 500ms per request

### Load Test: Multiple Concurrent Rejections
1. Create 50 pending requests
2. Reject all 50 requests simultaneously
3. âœ… All refunds initiated
4. âœ… No duplicate refunds
5. âœ… All refund records created
6. âœ… Response time < 1000ms per request

## Monitoring Checklist

### Backend Logs to Monitor
- âœ… Request acceptance logs with amounts
- âœ… Refund initiation logs
- âœ… Refund completion/failure logs
- âœ… Payment capture confirmations
- âœ… Error logs for failed operations

### Metrics to Track
- âœ… Request approval rate
- âœ… Request rejection rate
- âœ… Average refund processing time
- âœ… Failed refund count
- âœ… Total earnings per DJ
- âœ… Average request amount

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Refund Not Processing
1. Check backend logs for error messages
2. Verify M-Pesa credentials are correct
3. Check if payment record exists
4. Verify refund record status in database

### Issue: Earnings Not Updating
1. Verify request status is ACCEPTED
2. Check if payment record exists
3. Verify earnings API filters by status

### Issue: WebSocket Not Broadcasting
1. Verify WebSocket connection is active
2. Check broadcaster service logs
3. Test with multiple clients
