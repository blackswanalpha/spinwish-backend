# Song Request Management Implementation

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive song request management features in the DJ portal's Live Session screen, allowing DJs to accept, reject, and mark requests as played with a beautiful glassmorphism modal interface.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Request Status Management

**Three Status Actions:**
- **Accept** - DJ accepts the request, earns the tip amount, and the song is automatically added to the queue
- **Reject** - DJ declines the request (tip is refunded to the requester)
- **Mark as Played** - DJ marks the song as completed after playing it

**Status Flow:**
```
PENDING → Accept → APPROVED → Mark as Played → PLAYED
        ↓
        Reject → REJECTED (tip refunded)
```

### 2. ✅ Glassmorphism Modal UI

**Features:**
- Semi-transparent background with blur effect (BackdropFilter)
- Smooth scale and fade animations
- Comprehensive song and requester information display
- Context-aware action buttons based on request status
- Responsive design with max-width constraint

**Modal Contents:**
- Song details (title, artist, album)
- Album artwork placeholder
- Requester name and information
- Tip amount (in KSh)
- Request timestamp
- Current status badge
- Optional message from requester
- Action buttons (Accept/Reject or Mark as Played)

### 3. ✅ Interactive Request Cards

**Quick Actions on Each Card:**
- **Pending Requests**: Show "Accept" and "Reject" buttons
- **Approved Requests**: Show "Mark as Played" button
- **Tap to Open Modal**: Full details and management options

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Hover-ready design (tap on mobile)
- Status badges with color coding
- Tip amount highlighted in green
- Message preview (truncated to 2 lines)

### 4. ✅ Backend Integration

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `PUT /requests/{id}/accept` - Accept a request
- `PUT /requests/{id}/reject` - Reject a request
- `PUT /requests/{id}/done` - Mark as played

**Services Integrated:**
- `UserRequestsService.acceptRequest(requestId)`
- `UserRequestsService.rejectRequest(requestId)`
- `UserRequestsService.markRequestAsDone(requestId)`

**Real-time Updates:**
- Automatic UI refresh after status changes
- WebSocket integration via `RealTimeRequestService`
- Auto-refresh fallback (30 seconds)

### 5. ✅ Error Handling

**Implemented:**
- Network failure handling with user-friendly error messages
- Confirmation dialog for reject action
- Loading states during API calls
- Retry capability (user can try again after error)
- Mounted checks to prevent memory leaks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Animation System

**Modal Entry Animation:**
```dart
AnimationController(duration: 300ms)
├─ ScaleAnimation (CurvedAnimation with easeOutBack)
└─ FadeAnimation (CurvedAnimation with easeOut)
```

**Modal Exit Animation:**
```dart
_animationController.reverse() → Navigator.pop()
```

### State Management

**Local State:**
- `_isProcessing` - Tracks API call in progress
- Prevents duplicate submissions
- Shows loading indicator

**Global State:**
- `RealTimeRequestService` - Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Auto-refresh timer (30s fallback)
- Listener pattern for updates

### Error Handling Pattern

```dart
try {
  await UserRequestsService.acceptRequest(requestId);
  // Success notification
  _loadRequests(); // Refresh list
} catch (e) {
  // Error notification with details
  setState(() => _isProcessing = false); // Reset state
}
```

### Confirmation Dialog

Used for destructive actions (reject):
```dart
final confirmed = await showDialog<bool>(
  context: context,
  builder: (context) => AlertDialog(
    title: 'Reject Request?',
    content: 'Tip will be refunded...',
    actions: [Cancel, Reject],
  ),
);
if (confirmed != true) return;
```

## Design System Integration

### Colors
- **Green** - Accept, approved status, tip amounts
- **Red** - Reject, error messages
- **Orange** - Pending status, rejection notifications
- **Blue** - Mark as played

### Spacing
- Uses `SpinWishDesignSystem` constants throughout
- Consistent padding: `paddingMD`, `paddingLG`, `paddingXL`
- Consistent gaps: `gapVerticalMD`, `gapHorizontalSM`, etc.

### Shadows
- Card shadows: `shadow2XL` for modal
- Subtle shadows on request cards
- Elevation-based visual hierarchy

### Border Radius
- Cards: `radiusMD` (16px)
- Modal: `radiusLG` (24px)
- Buttons: `radiusSM` (12px)
- Status badges: `radiusFull` (fully rounded)

---

## API Integration

### Accept Request
```dart
POST /requests/{requestId}/accept
Response: PlaySongResponse (updated status)
Side Effects:
  - Request status → accepted
  - Song added to queue
  - DJ earnings updated
  - WebSocket broadcast to all clients
```

### Reject Request
```dart
POST /requests/{requestId}/reject
Response: PlaySongResponse (updated status)
Side Effects:
  - Request status → rejected
  - Tip refunded to requester
  - WebSocket broadcast to all clients
```

### Mark as Done
```dart
POST /requests/{requestId}/done
Response: PlaySongResponse (updated status)
Side Effects:
  - Request status → played
  - Analytics updated
  - WebSocket broadcast to all clients
```

---

## Real-time Updates

### WebSocket Integration
```dart
RealTimeRequestService
├─ Listens to request updates
├─ Notifies listeners on changes
└─ Triggers UI refresh automatically
```

### Fallback Mechanism
```dart
Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 30), (timer) {
  if (mounted) _loadRequests();
});
```

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Accept pending request → Status changes to approved
- [ ] Reject pending request → Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Confirm rejection → Tip refunded notification
- [ ] Mark approved request as played → Status updates
- [ ] Tap request card → Modal opens with animation
- [ ] Close modal via X button → Modal closes smoothly
- [ ] Close modal via backdrop tap → Modal closes
- [ ] Quick action buttons work on cards
- [ ] Real-time updates reflect immediately

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Glassmorphism effect visible and attractive
- [ ] Animations smooth (300ms duration)
- [ ] Loading state shows during API calls
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Success notifications appear and auto-dismiss
- [ ] Status badges color-coded correctly
- [ ] Buttons disabled during processing
- [ ] Modal responsive on different screen sizes

### Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Network failure → Error message shown
- [ ] Invalid request ID → Appropriate error
- [ ] Unauthorized action → Error handled
- [ ] Rapid button clicks → Prevented by loading state
- [ ] Modal closed during API call → No memory leak

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Request with no message → UI handles gracefully
- [ ] Request with long message → Truncated properly
- [ ] Request with no song data → Fallback text shown
- [ ] Multiple requests updated simultaneously → All update
- [ ] Session ends during action → Handled gracefully

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Const constructors where possible
- Efficient list rebuilding (only affected items)
- Debounced search input
- Lazy loading for large request lists
- Proper disposal of controllers and listeners

### Memory Management
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _animationController.dispose();
  _requestUpdateSubscription?.cancel();
  _autoRefreshTimer?.cancel();
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Batch Actions** - Accept/reject multiple requests at once
2. **Drag to Reorder** - Manually adjust queue order
3. **Request Analytics** - Show acceptance rate, average tip, etc.
4. **Smart Suggestions** - AI-powered request recommendations
5. **Custom Rejection Reasons** - Let DJ specify why they rejected
6. **Tip Negotiation** - Allow counter-offers for requests
7. **Priority Tiers** - VIP requests with higher tips
8. **Request Scheduling** - Schedule when to play accepted requests

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Queue Integration** - Currently relies on backend to add to queue automatically
2. **Offline Mode** - Requires internet connection for all actions
3. **Undo Action** - No way to undo accept/reject (would need backend support)
4. **Bulk Operations** - Can only manage one request at a time
5. **Request Filtering** - Limited to basic status filters

---

## Dependencies

### Required Packages
- `flutter/material.dart` - UI framework
- `dart:ui` - BackdropFilter for glassmorphism
