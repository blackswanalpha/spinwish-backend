```properties
spotify.fetch.enabled=false
```

### Adjust Rate Limiting
```properties
spotify.fetch.rate-limit-delay-ms=500  # Slower (safer for API limits)
```

### Change Sync Frequency
Edit `SpotifyFetchService.java` line 75:
```java
@Scheduled(fixedRate = 66000)  // Change to desired milliseconds
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Songs Appearing

**Check 1: Is the service running?**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/spotify/health
```

**Check 2: Are there any errors in logs?**
```bash
tail -f backend.log | grep -i error
```

**Check 3: Trigger manual sync**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/spotify/sync
```

**Check 4: Wait and check again**
```bash
sleep 30
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/spotify/stats
```

### Authentication Errors

If you see "Failed to authenticate with Spotify API":

1. Verify credentials are correct in `SpotifyConfig.java`
2. Check Spotify Developer Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
3. Ensure your app is active (not deleted or suspended)
4. Try regenerating Client Secret if needed

### Rate Limit Errors

If you see "429 Too Many Requests":

1. Increase delay in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spotify.fetch.rate-limit-delay-ms=500
   ```
2. Wait a few minutes for rate limit to reset
3. Restart the application
